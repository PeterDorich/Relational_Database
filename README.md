# Relational_Database
Relational Database project with simple UI

The idea was to create an abstract database with ACID properties.

I decided to create a database for a made up bike shop rental service in which customers can log in online and reserve a bike.

**Note this project was originally hosted on a school web server, which no longer exists.
